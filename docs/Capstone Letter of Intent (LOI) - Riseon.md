**Capstone Letter of Intent (LOI) Example**

**I. Project Overview**

* **Capstone Project Name/Idea:** Riseon \- Fearless Investing (a copy trading, SocialFi app)  
* **Brief Project Description:** Riseon is a platform where crypto influencers sell their copy trades, create exclusive clubs for alpha sharing, and sell various digital goods related to crypto trading. It also gives power back to novice traders and balances the ecosystem by allowing traders who follow influencers to rate, review and view the past performance of these copy trades they are buying. The copy trading wallets are anti-rug protected, and novice users have better insight into the people in the ecosystem by having others review them.  
* **Reason for Choosing this Project:** I'm passionate about this project, because I think finding a meaningful solution to constant crypto scams, and rug pulls will make this entire ecosystem much more healthy. For that, we need to give crypto influencers ways to monetize their audience without resorting to rug pulls and scams. And we need to empower novice traders who fall prey to these scams, by giving them more information about the people they are dealing with, and performance insights into the trading strategies they employ. Furthermore, we need to give tools to crypto meme coin influencers so that their alpha stays exclusive in a PvP environment, where every leakage is possible loss of revenue.

**II. Go-to-Market Strategy**

* **Target Audience:**  
  * Degens: novice crypto traders, or even seasoned traders who are looking for new alpha.  
  * Crypto influencers: people with large social media followings on twitter, twitch tiktok etc.  
* **Value Proposition:**  
  * For Crypto Influencers: ways to monetize their following, revenue sharing and better tools to preserve value of their alpha.  
  * For Degens: safety, trust and verifiability.  
* **Marketing and Distribution:**  
  * Partnerships with crypto influencers \+ revenue sharing \+ referral discounts \+ airdrops.  
  * Social media campaigns targeting novice users.  
* **Competitive Landscape:** At the moment, the primary competition for such tools are various communities on telegram:  
  * Telegram Bots: Bananabot, Maestro, BullX, Trojan Bonkbot and others. The bots offer sniping, wallet copy trading and anti-rug features.  
  * **Riseon** aims to offer a better solution for telegram trading, to allow experts to handle the trading for you, and provide a platform where you can trust these experts not to scam you out of your money, through social verification mechanisms.

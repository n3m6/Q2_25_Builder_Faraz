## Project Name: Riseon

**Value Proposition:** Riseon is a platform where crypto influencers sell their copy trades, create exclusive clubs for alpha sharing, and sell various digital goods related to crypto trading. It also gives power back to novice traders and balances the ecosystem by allowing traders who follow influencers to rate, review and view the past performance of these copy trades they are buying.

**Product-Market Fit:** Riseon achieves product-market fit by serving both crypto influencers seeking ethical monetization and novice traders demanding scam-resistant tools through a platform that merges anti-rug copy trading, exclusive alpha clubs, and community-driven accountability. Riseon disrupts Telegramâ€™s risky bot ecosystems, by enabling influencers and trading experts to profit from their time-tested strategies and exclusive content while empowering users with transparent performance metrics. The platform aligns influencer success with follower trust, creating a balanced, fraud-resistant ecosystem where transparency drives growth and reduces systemic scams.
